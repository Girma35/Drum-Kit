## Description

Drum Kit is an interactive and fun web application that allows users to play drum sounds by pressing keys on their keyboard. The project demonstrates the use of event listeners, audio playback, and dynamic class manipulation in JavaScript, combined with HTML and CSS for structure and styling.
